 Hi I'm Rohit here I have developed movie app using React, Typescript, Redux toolkit
### Step to Run the code  
- npm install
- npm start
### To run test cases npm run test
 - npm run test

# Explanation of Work
  - I have used typescript instead of normal javascript in app
  - I have used redux toolkit fot state management
 - Implemented infinite Scrolling from scratch
 - You can search movie based on the name
 - I have used thunk middleware to handle aync api call in redux toolkit
 - 
# What i can improve?

- I have written test cases using React testing library
- But due to time issue some issue is left
